# lab_sessions_COMP0245_PUBLIC
lab_sessions_COMP0245 accessible to everyone


this repository contains the code that will be added every week for the lab session in COMP0245
due to the block module structure the week has this name such as week1 and week1_2 which means this are lab sessions for the first week etc..

This Repository is a first term University project repository forked from a professor. As of today (09/12/2025) the project will be archived as it is no longer in use and will simply be used as a read ONLY. Thanks :)
